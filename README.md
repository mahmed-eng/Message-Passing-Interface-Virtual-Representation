# MPI Virtual Representation

## Overview

MPI Virtual Representation is a simplified visual simulation of message passing between processors, inspired by the concept of MPI (Message Passing Interface). This program is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to illustrate the basic idea of processors sending messages in a virtual environment.

## Features

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Decorative and visually appealing representation of processors.
- Simulation of processors sending and receiving messages.
- Simple user interface for entering messages and triggering message passing.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a message in the "Enter Message" input field.
3. Click the "Send Message" button to simulate message passing between processors.
4. Observe the changes in processor states and messages.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the program structure.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the program.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the program logic.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the styles, layout, and logic according to your preferences. This is a simplified educational example and not a real MPI implementation.
